# FourTwoCommando
A website for a military simulation group, simulating British 42 Commando Royal Marines in simulation game ArmA 3.

## About 42 Commando
42 Commando (named after the British Royal Marines, pronounced "four two commando") is a United Kingdom based military simulation unit. The unit hosts fictional military-esque events
for its members each Saturday in the online military simulation video-game ArmA 3.

## About the website
42 Commando will primarily use this website as a portfolio, and a means for its members to register attendance for their Saturday events.
More features may be introduced on demand of the unit.

## Personal affiliation
I have made this website as I am a member of 42 Commando myself and found this project is a good means to train and improve my programming skills, without too many consequences or hard
deadlines.

# Disclaimer
The unit 42 Commando is in no way affiliated to, supported by or related to the real British Royal Marines.
The existence of the unit solely rests on hobbies and friends playing games together.
